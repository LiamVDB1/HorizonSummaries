Office Hours Context:
"Jupiter’s Office Hours are weekly sessions hosted by the Core Working Group (CWG) and various other working groups. These meetings provide an open platform for community members to discuss topics related to the DAO, governance, ongoing working group projects, and broader Web3 initiatives. It’s an excellent opportunity for members to ask questions, provide feedback, and gain insights into the latest developments in the Jupiter ecosystem. Additionally, specific sessions are often allocated for catdets and other contributors to present their own initiatives and engage with the community on a more personal level"

Jupiter Context:
"Jupiter is a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on Solana, initially known as the top aggregator for token swaps. Beyond its roots in trading, Jupiter has grown into a dynamic ecosystem that offers perpetual trading, liquidity provision, and governance mechanisms. At its heart is the Jupiverse, which integrates all aspects of the platform into a cohesive community-driven environment.

The Jupiverse refers to the collective of users, working groups, contributors, and developers working together to shape Jupiter’s future. DAO governance is a crucial element, where $JUP holders vote on decisions ranging from project launches to strategic changes. The working groups, such as the Core and Uplink groups, handle vital aspects like community management, ecosystem token lists, and the LFG launchpad process ￼ ￼. These groups are the engines that power Jupiter’s growth, facilitating everything from grant programs to token curations.

The LFG Launchpad empowers the community to decide which new projects within the Solana ecosystem receive support, creating a continuous cycle of innovation ￼. Through these initiatives, the Jupiverse embodies a thriving DeFi ecosystem built on collaboration, transparency, and decentralized governance.

With this comprehensive framework, Jupiter has become a central hub of decentralized finance, fostering community participation while advancing DeFi on Solana"

🎤 **The Big Idea**: A community-driven "Jupiter's Home" video campaign!  No bounties, just pure Jupiverse passion!  Everyone is encouraged to create a short video saying "Jupiter's Home" and share it on social media. The working groups will compile these into one epic video showcasing the global reach and spirit of the Jupiter community. 🌎

💡 **Other Cool Ideas**:
-  A Jupiverse "end-of-year" documentary-style video, capturing the journey, challenges, and triumphs of the DAO and its working groups. 🎥
-   A retrospective look at the impact of Jupiter and its airdrop on community members' lives. 💖

- **Q:**  Is there a difference between being rewarded and taking a salary with DAO grants?
- **A:** Grants are meant to reward contributions, not replace salaries.  Ask for enough to prove your value and justify future funding.  Multiple grants for the same project are possible. Uplink grants and other proof of work also count towards demonstrating value.

**🔥 Takeaway:**

This Office Hours ignited a spark of collaborative energy. The "Jupiter's Home" campaign is just the beginning! Get involved, share your voice, and help shape the future of Jupiter! LFG! ✨"
